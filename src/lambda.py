"""
Simple Python Lambda service that provides simple responses to simple "fact"-like intents.
This file supports the following:
Intents supported:
  Custom:
    About
    Contact
    Upcoming
  Required:
    LaunchRequest (request type that calls launch function)
    AMAZON.HelpIntent (intent that calls help function)
    AMAZON.CancelIntent or AMAZON.StopIntent (intent, both use end function)
Note, that as long as you keep your intents are in sync with your skill intentSchema, you can
simply update or add intents as functions here and the lambda service will use them.
Intents in your Schema may be mixed case -- this code will convert to lower case.
